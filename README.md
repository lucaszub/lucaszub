### Why I love Azure:
Azure provides a robust, secure, and scalable environment for building applications in the cloud. Its seamless integration with various services (like Azure Web App, Azure Container Registry) makes deployment easy and efficient. The Azure platform offers great support for automating processes and deploying scalable solutions, which aligns perfectly with my focus on building efficient and reliable backend systems.
